# Binary Search Tree & Red-Black Tree implementations in Rust

A basic project to cut my teeth on some rust development. I gravitated towards this project due to the challenge that recursive data structures presented in the language.

_Note:_ This is not meant to be a fully performance tuned solution,
which would likely require the use of `unsafe` blocks to achieve.

## Future Improvements To Come:
1) Implementation of the `remove` method for `RedBlackTree`
2) Thread-safe implementations of `insert`, `remove`, and `find` for both tree implementations
3) The performance optimized, unsafe versions of both ðŸ˜ˆ
